I developed this Google Script when I was working as Player Support Shift Lead.

When I joined the project, I was asked to complete this weekly task where I had to review the Subject Lines that were entered by Player Support Agents. I had to check a few, randomly selected, fix the wrong ones and tell agents so that they didn't make the same mistakes. 

With this Google Script, I was able to check all of them so that no wrong Subject Lines were left unfixed. In order to make it easier for you, I have included a template in the project's folder. Feel free to grab it and work from there. As soon as the template is imported to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Sheets</a>, you will have to create a button on the Sheet called <code>Instructions</code>. That button will have to be linked to the Script called <code>ps_sf_subject_lines_review</code>.<br />

Some tickets were added to the Spreadsheet so that you can go ahead and run the Script right away. Before doing so, do not forget to data validate the column <code>B</code> of the Sheet called <code>Working sheet</code> so that a drop-down list is shown with the following options: "Pass" and "Fail".
