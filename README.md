I developed this Google Script when I was working as Player Support Shift Lead.

When I joined the project, I was asked to complete this weekly task where I had to review the Subject Lines that were entered by Player Support Agents. I had to check a few, randomly selected, fix the wrong ones and tell agents so that they didn't make the same mistakes. 

With this Google Script, I was able to check all of them so that no wrong Subject Lines were left unfixed.

A guide will be recorded and provided by me as soon as possible.
